CoinPool instances could be used in various scenarios: an alternative off-chain payment system,
operating a business with many stakeholders, paying out to subscription services, etc.

We will be expanding this page with more exaples soon.

For now, we refer you to the Section 8 in the [paper](https://coinpool.dev/).
