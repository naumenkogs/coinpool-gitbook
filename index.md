CoinPool is a second-layer Bitcoin protocol: it allows to make Bitcoin transfers cheaper and faster.

In some sense, it is an alternative to the Lightning Network, supposedly more efficient and usable
in certain cases.

It is a work-in-progress. This website gathers all the resources required to understand CoinPool
and contribute to it.

This website is also a work-in-progress. We will be extending it with more content.
