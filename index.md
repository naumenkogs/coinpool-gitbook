CoinPool is a work-in-progress second-layer Bitcoin protocol: it allows to make Bitcoin transfers cheaper and faster.
In some sense, it is an alternative to the Lightning Network, supposedly more efficient and usable
in certain cases.

This website gathers all the resources required to understand CoinPool and contribute to it.

If you're a Bitcoin engineer/academic interested in payment pools & covenants research and you want to get involved, reach out via contact@coinpool.dev. Same address if you want to support long-term scalability of Bitcoin via funding this project.

The ideas expressed on the website are derived from the progress of the community of Bitcoin protocol devs. We do our best to represent these ideas fairly by following scientific and engineering standards.
